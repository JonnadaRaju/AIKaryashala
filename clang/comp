Algorithm: Read two numbers and print as 200 is greater than 150.
step-1: start
step-2: print "To compare two numbers and print which is greater.\n"
step-3: print "Enter the first number: "
step-4: read Num1
step-5: print "Enter the second number: "
step-6: read Num2
step-7: Greater = " is greater than "
step-8: if Num1 > Num2:
			print Num1 + Greater + Num2 + ".\n"
			goto step-10
step-9: print Num2 + Greater + Num1 + ".\n"
step-10: stop
